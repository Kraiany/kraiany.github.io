Parents and teachers actively participated in the preparation of NPO
Kraiany for special holiday cooking class. Various Christmas Ukrainian
dishes were interesting not only for Japanese guests. Young Ukrainians
leaving in Tokyo and vicinity also participated in the class and have
learned to cook by the recipes by our hosts.


Christmas attributes -- vertep, christmas pavuk (spider), didookh --
that were prepared by our hosts also caused huge interest among our
guests. But the biggest surprize was caused by performance of the
children and teachers of the Dzherelce sschool. They performed
traditional Ukrainian kolyadky (carols) and, of course, received presents.

Happy New Year and Happy Christmass to everyone! Happiness, health,
prosperity for every family ond glogy and victory to our Motherland Ukraine!
