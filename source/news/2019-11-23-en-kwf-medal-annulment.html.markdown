From: Ukrainian community in Japan "Kraiany"

To: KARATENOMICHI WORLD FEDERATION, Grandmaster and Chairman of the Board of Directors

Dear Sir/Madam,

It has come to our attention that during an event held by KWF on November 7-10, 2019, participants calling themselves "Donets People" or so-called "DNR" have been seen photographing themselves with a flag of the so-called "Donetsk People's Republic (DNR)".

Since 2013, Ukraine has been in a state of undeclared war with the Russian Federation for the sixth year. The Russian Federation, having started the war with annexation of the Crimean peninsula, deceitfully occupying part of the territories of Ukraine in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, has been financing and sending regular military units to fight against an independent Ukrainian state. The Russian Federation has also been regularly financing separatist movements via terrorist organizations that label themselves as "Donetsk People's Republic (DNR)" and "Luhansk People's Republic (LNR)".

These so-called republics are not recognized by the world community, which is also the official position of the Japanese government.

Representing a terrorist organization and taking photographs with said symbolism is not acceptable. We condemn such actions taken by said participants, as it undermines Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. These actions also harm political image of Japan and the work done by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. It is regrettable to see that a Japanese national sport, Karate, is being used for Russian propaganda and disinformation against Ukraine and Japan.

Individuals identified to be members of “DNR” and seen at the event are the following:

- Martynov Yurij Igorevich, (ru: Мартынов Юрий Игоревич, uk: Мартинов Юрій Ігорович) DOB: 1991/03/25
- Medvedev Andrej Valerevich (ru: Медведев Андрей Валерьевич, uk: Медведєв Андрій Валерійович) DOB: 1978/03/02
- Medvedeva Anna Anatolevna (ru: Медведева Анна Анатольевна, uk: Медведєва Ганна Анатоліївна) DOB: 1977/03/27

To rectify the damage caused by illegal and irresponsible actions of said participants, we demand that KWF officials strip of the medals or certificates awarded to participants of the so-called "DNR". We further demand that said participants are barred from future competitions.

We hope our concerns are heard for the protection of Ukraine, as well as protection of Japanese image and spirit of Karate.
