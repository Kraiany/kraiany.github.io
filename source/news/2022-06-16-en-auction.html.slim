    In support of the people of Ukraine, the art community in Tokyo and world renowned Ukrainian artists have come together for a charity art auction. Join us to explore how art can unite people globally in resilience, defiance, and hope in the face of war. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to humanitarian relief in Ukraine.
