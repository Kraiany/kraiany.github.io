&lt;p&gt;Almost twom months of the non-stop work of the amazing prosthetists and rehabilitators in Mie-ken in collaboration with NPN SanPanSa and our team from Kraiany bring closer dreams of our "Kitties" to reaturn to full life. Motivated, positive, hard workers have considerable success, surprising us and the doctors with the pace of rehabilitation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dream would not have been possible for them without the tireless work of Oleksandr Sokolenko among his fellow doctors, without the curatorship of the project by the NPO Kraiany Sofia Kataoka, without close cooperation with the NPO SanPanSa and, of course, without you, our benefactors. After all, it is carried out at your expense - caring people who support Ukraine, bring our victory and peace closer! A low bow to all of you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundraising ends in a day. But the project will last as long as help is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will win!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will restore our land!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Food and History"&lt;/a&gt; has been published in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the proceeds from the sale of this book will go humanitarian projects in Ukraine organized by NPO KRAIANY. So with the purchase of this book, you can not only familiarize yourself with our wonderful traditional cuisine, table manners and traditions, but also support the victims of the horrendous war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was truly fascinating, but not without its challenges. First, we wanted to convey the names as closest to the Ukrainian sound.  Second, not all ingredients can be found in Japanese stores. And most of all - finding replacement products that can still give the similar taste and to describe the process of their preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to everyone who contributed to this project!! It’s been truly an honor to be given the opportunity to work on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.asia/d/47c71i2"&gt;You can pre-order on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents and teachers actively participated in the preparation of NPO
Kraiany for special holiday cooking class. Various Christmas Ukrainian
dishes were interesting not only for Japanese guests. Young Ukrainians
leaving in Tokyo and vicinity also participated in the class and have
learned to cook by the recipes by our hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas attributes – vertep, christmas pavuk (spider), didookh –
that were prepared by our hosts also caused huge interest among our
guests. But the biggest surprize was caused by performance of the
children and teachers of the Dzherelce sschool. They performed
traditional Ukrainian kolyadky (carols) and, of course, received presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year and Happy Christmass to everyone! Happiness, health,
prosperity for every family ond glogy and victory to our Motherland Ukraine!&lt;/p&gt;

"Wear Vyshyvanka and support Ukraine" gathered for the 9th time to
celebrate this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo Ukrainan Vyshyvanka Parade is celebrated on 3rd Sunday of May
each year since 2013, initiated and organized by the Ukrainian community
in Japan "Kraiany" (NPO Kraiany), with the participation of Ukrainian
Emmassy to Japan and Mission of Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past years this event became one of the most attended event
presenting Ukrainian clture in Japan and created a platform for
communication and establishing links between Ukrainians and Japanese,
who are eager to learn about Ukraine. This year situation with
coronavirus COVID-19 prevented from holding traitional Vyshyvanks march
on the streets of Japanes capital Tokyo. It was decided to hold
Vyshyvanka Day instead as an open-air event with compliance with all
requirements of sicial distansing and individual protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parricaipated in the event Ukrainian citizens, Japanese friends and
people from other countries. There was also present representative of
the Mayor of City of Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the points of the event's program was a competition for the best
Vyshyvanka with a prizes. There was built an improvides stage, where
competitors in crateive and humoruos manner presented their outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainan folk dances, singing of Ukrainian songs, quiz with a homework
– all of this left an unique impression for the paricipants of the
event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's not the first time I am participating in the Vyshyvanka Parade. It
took me 2 and half hour to drive here. This is always exciting. These
events are necessity for Japanes.  Every such an event is a great
opportunity to learn something new about Ukraine and Ukrainians" – said
one of the attenders, while giving an interview to students of the
Ukrainian school "Dzherelce".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do hope that by the next time pandemia situaion will be better and we
will return to our usual format of the parade. After all, walking by the
streets of Tokyo singing Ukrianin song is a unique feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An exhibition of Ukrainian costumes was held on November 18-22 in the gallery of Bunka Gakuen in Tokyo. The exhibition presented 17 original costumes from 16 regions of Ukraine, as well as Rushnyk (embroidered cloth) from Central Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a small part of a large collection of Olena Skrypka, who has been collecting these costumes for 25 years from all regions of Ukraine. We are very glad that we could showcase this collection in Japan, feel the Ukrainian color and get acquainted with the regional features of the costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the author of the collection, Olena Skrypka, she began to collect this collection because she felt an inner need to preserve and pass on to the next generations what was part of the identity for Ukrainians. The Ukrainian traditional costume carries the energy of generations and it is through it that you can see the bright and charming soul of the Ukrainian people. We must cherish and cherish this legacy in order to be one and strong nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lecture was held during the exhibition about the particulars of the Ukrainian costume, masterclasses for making Motanka (rag doll), beading and embroidery classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was in preparation by the Ukrainian community in Japan for the last three years. We are very happy that this project has been realized thanks to the coordinated cooperation of the Embassy of Ukraine in Japan and Bunka Gakuen.&lt;/p&gt;
