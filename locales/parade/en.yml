        p1: 'Annual Tokyo Ukraine Parade will meet again in the heart of the capital of Japan, Ginza. First held in 2013, the Tokyo Ukraine Parade is informally connected to a series of worldwide “Vyshyvanka” (traditional Ukrainian embroidery) cultural parades held in cities in Ukraine and throughout the world. Although intended as a celebration of Ukraine’s traditional culture, it also has a deeper meaning for many participants due to the ongoing violence and occupation in parts of Ukraine. Everyone is welcome to participate!

          '
        p2: You can participate even without vyshyvanka, of course, in that case please try to wear something in yellow or blue color of the Ukrainian flag!
        p3: 'This is strictly a cultural event. Any political symbols, shouts, etc. are prohibited.
